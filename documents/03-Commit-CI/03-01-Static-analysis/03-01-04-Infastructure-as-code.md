### Tools
- #### Infrastructure as Code Scanning Tools: 
  + [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) - Prevent cloud misconfigurations during build-time for Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Serverless framework and other infrastructure-as-code-languages with Checkov by Bridgecrew
  + [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) - Best practices checker for Ansible
  + [puppet-lint](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint) - Check that your Puppet manifests conform to the style guide
  + [tfsec](https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec) - Security scanner for your Terraform code
  + [terrascan](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan) - Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure
  + [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) - A Pluggable Terraform Linter
  + [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) - Provide built-in policies to detect configuration issues in Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and CloudFormation. Also, you can write your own policies in Rego to scan JSON, YAML, etc, like Conftest.
  + [KICS](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics) - Find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle of your infrastructure-as-code with KICS by Checkmarx.
